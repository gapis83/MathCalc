This project is an advanced calculator implemented in C++17 following the MVC pattern. It allows users to perform calculations with integers and real numbers in exponential notation, evaluate arbitrary bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation, plot graphs of functions, and even calculate credit details using a credit calculator mode. The program features a separation of business logic from the user interface, ensuring code reusability and maintainability. The implementation includes unit tests using the GTest library and follows the Google coding style. The GUI is built using the Qt library, providing a modern and cross-platform graphical interface. The project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly calculator with advanced functionalities.
